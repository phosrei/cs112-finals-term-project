The General Multi-Routine Program is a versatile Java console application
designed to perform a wide range of tasks across three main categories:
**Math Routines**, **Recording Routines**, and **Miscellaneous Routines**.
This program is built as part of a final project for the 
Programming 1 course at Saint Louis University, demonstrating core
programming concepts and problem-solving techniques.
